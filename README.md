This folder contains the following files.  This is intended for hiring managers, potential colleagues, and professionals, to aid you in evaluating my technical capabilities and my past employment.

❶ Data Analyst + Staff Accountant ❶ 

Cover letter and two-page resume.


❷ Backgrounder ❷ 

As many facts and tidbits as I could cram into just one page, mixing together professional and leisure information.  Cites industry and size of company, P/T or F/T role, which software was used, etc.  See the spreadsheet for additional comments.


❸ Chronology ❸ 

Complete chronology of all my past employment, in an Excel-based list.  It is not a résumé, per se.  It cites industry and size of company, P/T or F/T role, which software was used, etc.  I have decided to remove it from self-serve access; please CONTACT ME to obtain this document.

❹ Commendations ❹ 
Previews of my professional references, plus examples of recognition and special achievement.

❺ Course Certificates ❺ Certificates for various online coursework, plus details of my planned future training.

❻ Course Since College ❻  A list that aggregates all of my academic experiences since attaining my BS degree in Finance.   I have decided to remove it from self-serve access; please CONTACT ME to obtain this document.

❼ Excel Samples ❼ Various Excel spreadsheet projects that you can review, on multiple workbook tabs.

❽ Just For Fun ❽ Cartoons and jokes I've acquired, pertaining to finance, accounting, data analytics, mathematics, computer science, etc.  Obviously, feel free to ignore this document entirely.

❾ PowerPoint Samples ❾ A few slides each from two PowerPoint slideshow presentations, that you can watch.  I don't think their subject matter will interest many people, so I've included only a few slides.  They are here to DEMONSTRATE that I have indeed used PowerPoint for business purposes.  If you wish to see the complete presentations, let me know.


Please contact me via E-Mail or LinkedIn inMail with any questions; thank you.
