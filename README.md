# 2018-samples

This infirmation is intended for hiring managers, potential colleagues, and professionals, to aid you in evaluating my technical capabilities and my past employment.  This folder contains the following files.


=== ATS Resume ===
An Applicant Tracking System-compliant résumé, presented in the traditional chronological layout
(While it has "good information," it is lengthy.  It is NOT meant for human consumption; but your ATS computer will love it!)


=== Chronology ===
Complete chronology of my past employment (Excel-based list; not a résumé)
(Cites industry and size of company, P/T or F/T role, which software was used, etc.  See the spreadsheet for additional comments)


=== Commendations  ===
Previews of my professional references, plus examples of recognition and special achievement.


=== Course Certificates ===
Certificates for various online coursework, plus details of my planned future training.


=== Excel Samples ===
Various Excel spreadsheet projects that you can review, on multiple workbook tabs.


=== Just For Fun ===
Cartoons and jokes I've acquired, pertaining to finance, accounting, data analytics, mathematics, computer science, etc.
(Just because I'm a bean-counter and data wrangler, that doesn't mean I have no sense of humor)
Obviously, feel free to ignore this document entirely.


=== PowerPoint Samples ===
A few slides each from two PowerPoint slideshow presentations, that you can watch.  I don't think their subject matter will interest many people, so I've included only a few slides.  They are here to DEMONSTRATE that I have indeed used PowerPoint for business purposes.  If you wish to see the complete presentations, let me know.


Please contact me via E-Mail or LinkedIn inMail with any questions; thank you.
