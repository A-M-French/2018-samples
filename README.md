# 2018-samples

This folder contains the following files.  This is intended for hiring managers, potential colleagues,
and professionals, to aid you in evaluating my technical capabilities and my past employment.


== ATS Resume ==
An ATS-compliant résumé, presented in the traditional chronological layout
(ATS = Applicant Tracking System, an HR management software, used by medium-/large-size
companies; this layout includes dates and duties for all jobs cited in my LinkedIn profile)
(While it has "good information," it is lengthy.  It is NOT meant for human consumption; but
your ATS computer will love it!)


== Chronology ==
Complete chronology of my past employment (Excel-based list; not a résumé)
(Cites industry and size of company, P/T or F/T role, which software was used, etc)
(See the spreadsheet for additional comments)


== Commendations  ==
Previews of my professional references, plus examples of recognition and special achievement


== Course Certificates ==
Certificates for various online coursework, plus details of my planned future training


== Excel Samples ==
Various Excel spreadsheet projects that you can review, on multiple workbook tabs


== PowerPoint Samples ==
A few slides each from two PowerPoint slideshow presentations, that you can watch
I don't think their subject matter will interest many people, so I've included only a few slides.
They are here to DEMONSTRATE that I have indeed used PowerPoint for business purposes.
If you wish to see the complete presentations, let me know.


Please contact me via E-Mail or LinkedIn inMail with any questions; thank you.
